## Install

```bash
npm install --save super-easy-react-forms
```

## Usage

Creating a form is simple. Just import the form components you want then put them together. I tried to make the componets work as closely to native HTML forms as I could.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

import { Form, Input, ValidationTypes } from "super-easy-react-forms";

class Example extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Form onSubmit={/* some method here */}>
        <Input
          name="text only"
          legend="Legend"
          label="text only"
          validation={ValidationTypes.TEXT}
          errorMessage="text only!!"
          isRequired
        />
      </Form>
    );
  }
}
```

## Form Component

The Form component is used to wrap all of the other components that make up the form. It handles the state of all child components. All form elements are controlled. You can also nest form elements inside of other html elements if you need to.

Each Form component has a built in submit button but you can also add other buttons by passing them in as child components. When the user submits valid input the forms onSubmit callback is passes an object containing all of the form values.

```jsx
<Form onSubmit={/* some method here */}>
  <Input name="name" label="required" isRequired />
  <button>Extra Button</button>
</Form>
```

## Input Component

The Input component works just like a normal HTML input tag but has a few extra options. here are the props you can pass in:

- name - the name of the element. Used to send data to the server. This is a required prop.
- className - the class to add to the wrapper
- errorMessage - text to show if there is a validation error
- missingMessage - Text to show if there is no value and the field is required
- isRequired - should this input be filled in?
- label - the label text to show
- legend - the legend text to show
- onBlur - called when the user leaves the input
- onChange - called when the value changes
- shouldPreventInvalid - stop the input of invalid characters
- validation - a function to call to see if this field is valid
- value - the value to show

```jsx
<Input
  name="name"
  className="myClass"
  label="required"
  legend="Legend"
  errorMessage="there was an error"
  value="test"
  isRequired
  shouldPreventInvalid
  validation={value => {
    return value === 5;
  }}
  onBlur={() => {
    //do something
  }}
  onChange={() => {
    //do something
  }}
/>
```

## TextArea Component

The TextArea component is similar to the input component excapt itshould be used for larger amounts of text. here are the props you can pass in:

- name - the name of the element. Used to send data to the server. This is a required prop.
- className - the class to add to the wrapper
- errorMessage - text to show if there is a validation error
- missingMessage - Text to show if there is no value and the field is required
- isRequired - should this input be filled in?
- label - the label text to show
- legend - the legend text to show
- onBlur - called when the user leaves the input
- onChange - called when the value changes
- shouldPreventInvalid - stop the input of invalid characters
- validation - a function to call to see if this field is valid
- value - the value to show

```jsx
<TextArea
  name="bio"
  className="myClass"
  label="required"
  legend="Legend"
  errorMessage="there was an error"
  value="test"
  isRequired
  shouldPreventInvalid
  validation={value => {
    //some validation here
  }}
  onBlur={() => {
    //do something
  }}
  onChange={() => {
    //do something
  }}
/>
```

## CheckBox Component

The CheckBox component is setup just like a normal html checkbox. The value field is used to set the value that is used when the box is checked. If the box isn't checked the value is blank. The checked prop tells the component if the box should be filled. here are the props you can pass in:

- name - the name of the element. Used to send data to the server. This is a required prop.
- className - the class to add to the wrapper
- missingMessage - Text to show if there is no value and the field is required
- isRequired - should this input be filled in?
- label - the label text to show
- legend - the legend text to show
- onBlur - called when the user leaves the input
- onChange - called when the value changes
- value - the value to set when the box is checked
- checked - is the boxchecked

```jsx
<CheckBox
  name="checkbox"
  legend="Legend"
  label="Test Check Box"
  value="test"
  missingMessage="you must select this"
  checked
  isRequired
  onBlur={() => {
    //do something
  }}
  onChange={() => {
    //do something
  }}
/>
```

## Select Component

The Select component is used for dropdown selections just like HTML select elements. By passing in Option components as children you can list any options the user can select.

- name - the name of the element. Used to send data to the server. This is a required prop.
- className - the class to add to the wrapper
- missingMessage - Text to show if there is no value and the field is required
- isRequired - should this input be filled in?
- label - the label text to show
- legend - the legend text to show
- onBlur - called when the user leaves the input
- onChange - called when the value changes
- value - the value to set=
- placeholder - the text to show if nothing is selected

```jsx
<Select name="selectTest" label="Select" placeholder="Select one" isRequired>
  <Option value="1">Option one</Option>
  <Option value="2">Option two</Option>
  <Option value="3">Option three</Option>
</Select>
```

## Validation

I tried to make the validation as flexibile as possible. To add validation to an input just pass a function to the
validation prop. It will be called any time validation is run and passed the value of the input. The function should
return true if the value is valid.

```jsx
<Input
  name="five-example"
  validation={value => {
    return value === 5;
  }}
/>
```

## Validation Types

To make validation even easier I have included a ValidationTypes object that has some prebuilt validation methods.
Just pick the one you need and pass it in.

so far I have these options:

- ValidationTypes.NUMBER
- ValidationTypes.TEXT

```jsx
<Input name="five-example" validation={ValidationTypes.NUMBER} />
```

## Required Fields

I wanted to be able to show different messaging for missing values than other types of validation so I setup a prop
specifically for required fields. Just add isRequired. By default the error message says "This field is required." but if you want to change it all you need to do is pass in your new message as the missingMessage prop.

```jsx
<Input name="required-example" isRequired />
```
